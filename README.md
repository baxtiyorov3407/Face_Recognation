## 📌 Overview

This project is a smart **patient reservation system** that uses **face recognition** to identify returning patients and store or retrieve their medical details.

When a new patient approaches the camera, they are prompted to enter their **name** and **health issue**. The system then captures their face and stores it alongside their data. The next time the patient appears, the system recognizes them automatically and retrieves their information.

This solution aims to make the hospital check-in process more seamless and contactless using computer vision and AI.
